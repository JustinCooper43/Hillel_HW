I have a cat and a dog. I got them at the same time as kitten/puppy. That was humanYears years ago. Calculate their respective ages now.

NOTES:
humanYears >= 1
humanYears are whole numbers only

Cat Years:
15 cat years for first year
+9 cat years for second year
+4 cat years for each year after that

Dog Years:
15 dog years for first year
+9 dog years for second year
+6 dog years for each year after that

EXAMPLE output:
HumanYears: 4
CatYears: 32
DogYears: 36
