# Task_1
Develop a program that can switch values between two variables:

int a = 9 int b = 6                  =>             int a = 6 int b = 9

-using additional variable
-without additional variable

# Task_2
I have a cat and a dog. I got them at the same time as kitten/puppy. That was humanYears years ago. Calculate their respective ages now.

NOTES:
humanYears >= 1
humanYears are whole numbers only

Cat Years:
15 cat years for first year
+9 cat years for second year
+4 cat years for each year after that

Dog Years:
15 dog years for first year
+9 dog years for second year
+6 dog years for each year after that

EXAMPLE output:
HumanYears: 4
CatYears: 32
DogYears: 36


# Task_3
Using ONLY loops and conditions write a program that prints these figures into output:


'#######    #######    #######'
'#     #     #              # '
'#     #      #            #  '
'#     #       #          #   '
'#     #        #        #    '
'#     #         #      #     '
'#######    #######    #######'

# Task_4
Given any sentence. Write a program that will change first letter of each word to capital letter

EXAMPLE:
